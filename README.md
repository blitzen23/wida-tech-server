# This is repository for the server side

I run it on localhost with the port of 5000 along with the database as you can see in the code.

I used NodeJS for this server side with the help of Express and MySQL for the database.

## How to run this
1. Cloning this project repository using one of the links below:
   ```
   - https://github.com/blitzen23/wida-tech-server.git
   - git@github.com:blitzen23/wida-tech-server.git
   - gh repo clone blitzen23/wida-tech-server
   ```
 2. Installing the dependencies.
    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Making the database first manually in your local.
   
4. Running the code
   ```
   nodemon index.js or node index.js
   ```
